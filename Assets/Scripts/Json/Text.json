    { "page": "September 5th\nMy new home is lovely, a big bed, a comfortable couch and a big office, what else could I ask for. The only problem is that there is a door in my office that is locked and can't be opened. I will call someone tomorrow to help me open the door so I can finally relax and enjoy all these years of hard work."},
    { "page": "September 6th\nSomething really weird happened today, the locksmith that I called couldn’t open the door, everything he tried did not seem to work. Is this a joke or did he try to trick me to get my money? Of course I didn’t pay him and I immediately called another locksmith, but to my surprise, he couldn’t open the door either!!! I am afraid that I'll have to break it open."},
    { "page": "September 20th\nI am going insane, this is not possible something is wrong, the door will not open whatever I do. I smash it with a hammer, nothing. I bash into it with all my power… nothing. What is going on? What is behind that door?"},
    { "page": "October 7th\nI am determined that the door will not open by ordinary means, my only hope now is to check the safe inside the documents room. I don’t know the code but there was a piece of paper near it that seamed like a riddle. Maybe if I solve it I will be able to take the key stored inside."}
