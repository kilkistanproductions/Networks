# Networks
A small easter egg from a network project i developed, have fun

#Note
The game was developed in 2 days and should not be taken seriously

#Instuctions
The project contains all of the unity project, but to play it you just need to download the linuxBuild(for linux) or winBuild(for windows) and run the executable. I recommend playing with a controller if possible.
